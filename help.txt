# Development and Execution Guide for Automate Automation Project

## Prerequisites
1. Install Python 3.11 or higher.
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure `PyInstaller` is installed for building the executable:
   ```
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: Entry point of the application.
- `config/`: Contains configuration files like `html_template.html` and `testcase_template.xlsx`.
- `custom_actions/`: Contains custom action scripts.
- `Logs/`: Stores execution logs.
- `Reports/`: Stores generated reports and screenshots.
- `modules/`: Contains supporting modules like `reporting` and `selenium_actions`.

## Running the Project
1. To execute the project directly:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
2. Ensure the `config` folder and its contents are present in the working directory.

## Building the Executable
1. Ensure the `AutomateAutomation.spec` file is correctly configured to include the `config` and `custom_actions` folders.
2. Build the executable using PyInstaller:
   ```
   pyinstaller --clean --noconfirm AutomateAutomation.spec
   ```
3. The built executable will be located in the `dist/` folder.

## Post-Build Execution
1. After building the executable, ensure the following folders are present in the same directory as the `.exe` file:
   - `config/`
   - `Logs/`
   - `Reports/`
2. The `config` folder should contain:
   - `html_template.html`
   - `testcase_template.xlsx`

## Notes
- The `Logs` and `Reports` folders will be automatically created during execution if they do not exist.
- Ensure all dependencies in `requirements.txt` are installed before running or building the project.
- For custom actions, add your scripts to the `custom_actions/` folder and ensure they are imported dynamically in `main.py`.

## Troubleshooting
- If the `config` folder is missing, the application will raise an error. Ensure it is present in the working directory.
- If the executable does not run as expected, check the logs in the `Logs/` folder for detailed error messages.
