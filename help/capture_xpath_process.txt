# How to Capture XPaths Using capture_xpath.py

1. Set the Default URL
   - The script will open the following URL by default:
     
     https://www.google.com
   - To change the URL, edit the `default_url` variable at the top of `capture_xpath.py`.

2. Run the Capture Script
   - Open a terminal in your project directory.
   - Activate your virtual environment if not already active.
   - Run the script:
     
     ```
     python modules/capture_xpath.py
     ```

3. Capture XPaths
   - The browser will open.
   - Press `F9` to enable capture mode.
   - Click on any element in the browser to capture its details and XPaths.
   - Press `F9` again to disable capture mode.
   - Repeat as needed. Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to exit.

4. Check Captured XPaths
   - All captured selectors are saved in the `captured_xpaths` folder in your project root.
   - You will find:
     - `element_selectors.csv` (for quick reference)
     - `element_selectors.json` (with full details)

5. Stop 
   - In terminal press Ctrl+C

Tip:
- You can open any URL by changing the `default_url` variable before running the script.
- The CSV file is useful for copying XPaths into your automation data sheets.
