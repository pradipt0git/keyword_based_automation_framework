# First Time Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project for the first time:

1. Clone the Repository
   - Download or clone the project from your source control (e.g., GitHub).

2. Open a Command Prompt
   - Navigate to the project folder in Windows Explorer.
   - Right-click and select "Open in Terminal" or "Open Command Prompt Here".

3. Run the Setup Script
   - Execute the following command to create a virtual environment and install all required packages:

     ```
     first_setup_venv.bat
     ```
   - This will automatically create a `.venv` folder and install all dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

4. Activate the Virtual Environment
   - After setup, activate the virtual environment with:

     ```
     .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
     ```
   - You should see `(.venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt line.

5. Run the Automation Framework
   - To start the framework, run:

     ```
     python main.py
     ```

---

Note:
- Always activate the virtual environment before running the project.
- If you add new packages to `requirements.txt`, re-run the setup script or use `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside the activated venv.
- For any issues, check the `Logs` folder for error details.
