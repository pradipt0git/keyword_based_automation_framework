Copy the following folders and files into the deployment folder before sharing:
captured_xpaths
config
drivers
Logs
modules
capture_xpath_config.json
requirements.txt

Do NOT include .venv if you want users to run setup themselves. If you want to ship with .venv, run 'start_app.bat' first, then copy .venv into deployment.

 - deployment/ (this folder)
Make sure msedgedriver.exe is present in drivers/.
